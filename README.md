Tuberculosis & Tobacco Use in India: Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes tuberculosis patient data in India, focusing on tobacco usage, cessation linkage, and diabetes comorbidity. Using data visualization and basic analytics, we explore insights to inform public health decision-making.

Dataset Summary
Data Source: nitiaayog
Main Features:
Number of TB patients with known tobacco status
Number and percentage identified as tobacco users
Linkage to cessation centers
TB and Diabetes comorbidity
Year-wise and State-wise breakdown

Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned column names for readability
- Extracted numeric year
- Created state-wise aggregation
- Calculated:
Identification_Rate = Identified / Known
Linkage_Rate = Linked / Identified
DM_Treatment_Rate = DM Treated / TB-DM

Visualizations
Line Plot
Lollipop Chart
Correlation Heatmap
Histogram
Scatter Plot

Key Insights
- Identification and linkage vary widely by state
- Some states perform well in screening but poorly in follow-up
- Diabetes comorbidity is under-treated in several high-burden states
- Tobacco linkage does not always correlate with high identification

Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning with Pandas
- Exploratory visualizations with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Derived metrics for real-world insight
